description: Learn about the OSS workspace and its projects
---

Welcome to the OSS workspace documentation! This workspace contains a collection of Nx plugins and tools designed to enhance modern development workflows, particularly for Go and Cloudflare ecosystems.

## About This Workspace

The OSS workspace is a monorepo that houses multiple interconnected projects, each solving specific development challenges:

- **GoNx** - A modern Nx plugin for Go/Golang development
- **Nx Cloudflare** - Comprehensive Cloudflare integration for Nx workspaces

## Philosophy

Our projects are built around these core principles:

### Modern Nx First
We embrace the latest Nx features and capabilities, including:
- Inferred tasks for seamless project detection
- Advanced caching strategies
- GraphV2 support
- Modern project graph integration

### Non-Invasive Tooling
We believe in generating minimal, focused tooling that enhances rather than replaces existing workflows. Our plugins work alongside your existing tools and practices.

### Official Command Integration
Rather than reinventing the wheel, we leverage official commands and tools from their respective ecosystems (Go's official toolchain, Cloudflare's Wrangler CLI, etc.).

## Community

We value community contributions and feedback. Here's how you can get involved:

- **Discord**: Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zjDCGpKP2S) for real-time discussions
- **GitHub**: Contribute to our [open source repository](https://github.com/naxodev/oss)
- **Issues**: Report bugs and request features through GitHub Issues

## Getting Support

1. Check the documentation for your specific project (GoNx or Nx Cloudflare)
2. Search existing GitHub issues
3. Join our Discord community for quick questions
4. Create a new GitHub issue for bugs or feature requests

Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€
