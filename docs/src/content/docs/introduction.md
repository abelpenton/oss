## Philosophy

Our projects are built around these core principles:

### Modern Nx First
We embrace the latest Nx features and capabilities, including:
- Inferred tasks for seamless project detection
- Advanced caching strategies
- GraphV2 support
- Modern project graph integration

### Non-Invasive Tooling
We believe in generating minimal, focused tooling that enhances rather than replaces existing workflows. Our plugins work alongside your existing tools and practices.

### Official Command Integration
Rather than reinventing the wheel, we leverage official commands and tools from their respective ecosystems (Go's official toolchain, Cloudflare's Wrangler CLI, etc.).
