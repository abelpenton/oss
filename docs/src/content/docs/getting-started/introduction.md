## About This Workspace

The OSS workspace is a monorepo that houses multiple interconnected projects, each solving specific development challenges:

## Philosophy

Our projects are built around these core principles:

### Modern Nx First

We embrace the latest Nx features and capabilities, including:

- Inferred tasks for seamless project detection
- Advanced caching strategies
- GraphV2 support
- Modern project graph integration

### Non-Invasive Tooling

We believe in generating minimal, focused tooling that enhances rather than replaces existing workflows. Our plugins work alongside your existing tools and practices.

### Official Command Integration

Rather than reinventing the wheel, we leverage official commands and tools from the Go's official toolchain ecosystems.

## Community
